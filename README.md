# Logic Hunt Overview

## Description
Logic hunt is the online quiz platform in which I have worked as a backend developer. It was made for event named as Logic Hunt powered by <a href="http://encodepdeu.org/">Encode</a>. Logic hunt was an online quiz competition in which a team of two members participates to compete among other teams. 

## Usage
- The team first has to get registered through the registration portal made for the event. 
- A unique link to access the quiz was sent to the users through the mail.
- Only one member of the team can access the portal at a time. 
- The quiz includes 10 questions with a period of one hour.
- Users can get a maximum of 3 hints that can be used throughout the quiz. 
- If a user gives a correct answer they get plus 20 coins (If not used hint)/10 coins (It answered by using hint) and if they give the wrong answer 5 times in a row then 15 minutes get reduced from their time interval. 
- Users can buy a hint by spending 20 coins from their wallets.
- A live leaderboard was also built to view the positions of the participating team.
